# RUST-ON-JVM

Rust on Java-Virtual-Machine

Aims  to:
1.  Without-LLVM
2.  Rust memory safety(Stack) +  JVM  Garbage Collector(heap)  advantages dual safeness. 
3. Explictly  Garbage  collector  call  on  demand .  It  useul  for  predictable  perfomance.
4. Meaning-based  translations to  generate  the  bytecodes  that  is mid-level presentation of  the  machines  run on. Eventually  the Rust -> Bytecode ->  Target-machine-Codes.
